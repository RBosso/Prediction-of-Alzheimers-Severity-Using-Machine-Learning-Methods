# Prediction-of-Alzheimers-Severity-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods
Prediction of Alzheimer's severity with MRI scans, using PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Numpy.

This convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which can be viewed in the adjoining Jupyter Notebook, is still being fine-tuned for performance, and work is underway to expand the scope of this project to include other machine learning models, along with other features to be added in the future.
